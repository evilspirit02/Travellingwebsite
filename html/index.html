            Welcome to the “Land of Kings”. Rajasthan is a true state of contrasts, and Rajasthan travel reflects that!

            From desert scrub to holy lakes, one thing that is hard to grasp for the first-time (or even repeat) visitor is the sheer size of the place. I was fortunate enough to have three weeks to explore the desert state. Even that wasn’t sufficient to get to all of the major sights. I did, however, linger longer in areas that would be easier to pass through in a shorter time frame. I also went well off the path more trodden on a couple of occasions—which meant more travel time.
            
            In researching a state of contrasts, I was happy to find that the relatively well-developed tourism infrastructure is matched by the gradual appearance of eco-friendly options. More than that, were the options which make an effort to connect visitors to Rajasthani culture beyond a superficial level. Thereby creating more opportunities for responsible travel in Rajasthan.
